# options-handler

This application was created with the [create drachtio command](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-drachtio-app).  This documentation was generated at the time when the project was generated and describes the functionality that was initially scaffolded.  Of course, you should feel free to modify or replace this documentation as you build out your own logic.

## SIP Request Handling

Based on the options that you have chosen,this application handles the following incoming SIP requests:







### OPTIONS
The generated application responds with 200 to incoming OPTIONS messages (you should implement your own logic as appropriate).

## Tests
To run the generated test suite is a simple matter of:
```bash
$ npm test
```
Note that the test suite requires docker and docker-compose to be installed on your laptop/development machine.

You can also generate code coverage maps and put your code though a lint test
```bash
$ npm run coverage

$ npm run jslint
```

**Hint**: It is a good idea to continue to keep your test cases updated, and to build new ones to cover the additional functionality that you add over time.
